# Weather-station-with-Arduino-Nano-and-BME280-and-LCD1602

This local weather station uses a 16 x 2 LCD, SPI connection. It shows:
- temperature in Celsius degrees
- temperature in Fahrenheit degrees
- humidity in percentage
- pressure in mm Hg

I made it with Arduino Nano and also with a cheaper compatible board, TTGO Xi. I posted the schematics for both. The code is identical.

You can see it in function, with Arduino Nano board at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXF7moxwlPk
